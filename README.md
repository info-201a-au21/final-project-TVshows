# Final Project
### Helen Lei, Kelsey Li, Scarlet Zheng
## Domain of Interest
We are interested in the quality and popularity of TV shows in the mainstreaming platforms, including Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, and Disney+.

During the pandemic period, people stay at home and do limited activity. A tremendous amount of people tend to watch TV shows during quarantine. Streaming platforms have increasing subscribers. We would like to analyze the dataset from the leading streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, and Disney+) to help people find out the most recommended one.

Questions we hope to answer:
- Which platform is the most recommended for a family, which have children to subscribe?
- Which platform is more globalized (provides more options of caption or availability in more counties)?
- Which platform has the most enormous amount of TV shows?
